# working-with-PyTorch
This repo contains some of my initial practises that I did while starting off with Pytorch for the first time.
<br>
<li><b>Tensor_operations.ipynb </b>- This has some basic tensor operations that are helpful while programming a neural network while using pytorch
<li><b>intro.ipynb</b> - This contains some basic functions that are used while programming for a complete model
<li><b>NN for MNIST.ipynb </b>- A simple introductory model for the hand written digits dataset form MNIST.
<li><b>objected_oriented_nn.py </b>- Implementation of a summy Convolutional neural network in a object oriented manner using Pytorch.
